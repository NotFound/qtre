Revision 28-jan-2006

The menus are now in english by default. They can be translated
to another language with the menu_rename function. The /etc/qtre.pl
provided make the translation to spanish if the environment variable
LANG begin with 'es'.

Other texts are in english, and in this version there is no way to
translate it other than editing the sources.


***********************************************************
		Compiling qtre.
***********************************************************


You need to have a version of perl 5 that can load dynamic modules,
and the perl modules Config and ExtUtils::Embed.

To compile the module that links with perl library the compiler
used to build perl is used. You can override this by setting
the CC value in configure, in this case the Config module is
not used.

Also the library ncurses and his headers are required, look for the
packages ncurses and ncurses-dev, ncurses-devel or similar.

ncursesw is used instead of ncurses if available. If not available
using qtre under a locale that uses utf8 enconding can give
unexpected results.

To build qtre use the traditional ./configure ; make; make install

Use ./configure --help or read the INSTALL file for details.

The provided do_conf and do_confdeb scripts calls configure
with my preferred options (/usr/local prefix, but qtre.pl installed
in /etc instead of /usr/local/etc). The instructions assume
this configuration is used.

To install do "make install" as root. If you are upgrading form a
previous version you may want to save your /etc/qtre.pl first, it
will be overwriten.


***********************************************************
			Instructions.
***********************************************************


	Key assignments.


These are the default key assignments, they can be modified from
Perl or menu options.


- Mini help: F1.

- Menu: Ctrl-n, F10.

- Save: F2

- Quit: Ctrl-q. F8 closes current window and quit if no more windows.

- Selection: Control-s or 'Select' key (if your keyboard has one),
same for end selection.

- Cut: Control-x.

- Copy: Control-c.

- Paste: Control-v.

- Delete line: Control-y.

- Find: Control-f.

- Find again: Control-a

- Replace: Control-r

- Next window: F5

- Execute macro: Control-k, key.

- Evaluate a perl expression: Control-e.

- Save current file and compile it: Control-o + c.

- Change options used to compile: Control-o + o.

- Save all files and execute 'make': F7 or Control-o + m.

- Execute current line as shell command: F9

- Open the man page of the word under the cursor in a new document in
read only mode: F3


	Initialization files.


The following files are readed and executed during initializtion.

	1- /etc/qtre.pl
	2- .qtre.pl in user $HOME.
	3- .qtre.pl in current directory.

They are loaded as Perl packages. If one of them returns an error
qtre aborts, unless the environment variable QTRE_NO_ABORT is set.

The end_init function can be called from any of them to avoid reading
the others. The third is also omitted if the environment variable
QTRE_NO_DIR is set.

If the environment variable QTRE_NO_INIT is set, none of those files
are loaded.

See also the security notes below.


	Embedded Perl.


Qtre has a Perl interpreter embedded, that can be used in several
ways.

- A Perl function can be assigned to a control key with the menu
entry "perl / define control".

- A Perl function can be associated to macro keys (control-k + key).
This is done by defininig a function called qtre::macro_suffix,
where suffix can be a lowercase letter, a number, ctrl_ + lowercase
letter or the the charater code in uppercase hexadecimal for other
keys.

- The current line, the selected text, the clipboard content and
text written in a dialog box can be executed using several entries
in the perl menu.

- Qtre predefines several functions that can be called from perl,
they are defined inside the 'qtre' package, thus mey be prefixed
with 'qtre::' unless your code includes a 'package qtre;'
instruction. This functions can be redefined, to help when doing
this, a copy of each function is defined inside the 'qtre::default'
package so you can easily call the default version.

- Several menu options call predefined perl functions. Also some
functions are called, if exists, when doing several actions.
Defininig or redefining this functions can be useful to alter the
behaviour of qtre.

- A regular expression search and replace can use a perl function
to provide the result of the substitution. To do that specify p
and f in the replace options, and a perl function name as text to
be replaced. The function will be called with the matched text as
first parameter and the subexpressions of the result as additional
parameters.

- The predefined funcions and his use can be consulted in the menu
option "help/perl functions". There are several examples in the
qtre.pl and .qtre.pl included.

- The default qtre.pl redirects the Perl standard output file
descriptor, to make it insert text in the current document. That
way you can insert text with a simple print instruction.

- The dynamic loader of modules is included, so you can use any Perl
module inside qtre.


	Command line options.


+num Go to the line number num in the first file opened. num
must be an unsigned decimal integer.

-- No more options. Afther this all paramters are considered
filenames.

Using - as fileneame means create a file by reading the standard
input. In that case the standard error is used for interactive
input and output, do not redirect it.


	Editing remote files.


If a filename has the format [user@]host:file the file is copied
using scp in a temporary and this temporary is opened. When saving
the temporary is saved and copied back to the remote host. The
temporary is deleted when the file is closed.

To open a local file with a name that contains ':' must be
prefixed with ':'. Example: to open 'this:file' the name used
must be: ':this:file'.

Other ways to access remote files (ftp, http...) are not provided,
but can be programmed using perl and perl modules. For example,
the qtre.pl provided insert a menu option to load a file from a
url.

***********************************************************
		IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES.
***********************************************************


To avoid that malicious users can execute something in your
name by modifying the qtre initialization files, before
excuting them some checks are done:

	- /etc/qtre.pl must be owned by root and others can't
	have write permission in it. If the group is other
	than root is also checked that the group does not have
	write permission.

	- .qtre.pl files must be owned by the current user and
	the group and others must not have write permissions in
	it.

When any of this checks fails, the file is not loaded and a
warning is showed. The warning is omitted if the environment
variable QTRE_NO_WARN is set.
